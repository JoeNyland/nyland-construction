		<h1>About Nyland Construction</h1>
		<h2>Nyland Construction provide a wide range of services for our clients, from basic building repairs right through to completion of large projects.</h2>
		<h2>Building Refurbishments</h2>
		<p>Whether you have just moved into a new property, or want to have work done on your existing house to increase the value before you sell it, Nyland Construction of Warrington have a vast array of skills at your disposal.</p>
		<h2>Building Extensions</h2>
		<p>Wherever you're planning to build your extension it's important to think about how people can get to it from the rest of the house, and it's how you do that that often makes the difference between a good job and a bad one. Nyland Construction will see your extension from plan to completion, ensuring your new extension blends in harmoniously to your existing building.</p>
		<h2>Loft &amp; Garage conversions</h2>
		<p>Converting existing outbuildings and lofts into living space is something that many people believe applies only to people with older houses surrounded by stables and barns, but it could equally apply to garages and even urban properties that had outside toilets and coal sheds when they were first built. Anything that can be converted into living space can be used to give a family useful extra space, provide an office for working at home or perhaps a gym or games room.</p>
